# REIS: Receiver Efficiency & Impact Score

## Overview
REIS (Receiver Efficiency & Impact Score) is a multi-factor wide receiver evaluation framework designed to support football decision-making by balancing production, efficiency, reliability, and role context.

Rather than rewarding raw volume, REIS emphasizes how effectively receivers convert opportunities into offensive value.

The model is intended as a decision-support tool that complements film study and scouting evaluation.

---

## Objective
Wide receiver evaluation is often skewed by target volume and total production. REIS was developed to provide a structured lens that:

- Separates efficiency from volume-driven production
- Highlights sustainable performance profiles
- Connects on-field output to roster and cap decisions
- Directs attention toward deeper film evaluation

---

## Framework Structure

REIS evaluates receivers across four weighted pillars:

### Reliability (25%)
- Catch rate
- First-down conversion rate
- Success rate on targets

### Efficiency (30%)
- Yards per target
- Yards per reception
- Explosive play rate

### Impact (25%)
- Touchdowns
- Chain-moving plays
- Explosive gains

### Usage (20%)
- Targets per game
- Offensive involvement
- Share of passing offense

Each pillar is normalized and weighted into a composite 100-point score.

## Football Philosophy
REIS is designed to support film, not replace it.

The model highlights patterns, surfaces questions, and helps prioritize deeper evaluation. Receiver production is influenced by scheme, quarterback play, and coverage structure, so outputs are interpreted within context.
